complied & tested on g++ 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04

To complie run "make"

To run just a part use like "./A <N>" as example ./A 10 it gave output in "10" number of  thread

1st it will creat total N thread in which half are producer and half are consumer

2nd it has signal handler that put thread to sleep and wait for wake up call

3rd every time when ever any thread access shared buff, only one thread can access because of mutex lock

4th SCHEDULER thread will give 1 sec to every thread in a round-robin scheduling and it only allow one thread at time.

in result buff size will be in multiply of 1000 because when ever context swich accur it 1st producer store 1000 numbers in buff and for in 1 sec
consumer remove all the elements.
