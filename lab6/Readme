For A part;
To complie B part use "A.sh" file

To run A part use :Use this like : ./memory 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
Here 1st arugument is number of frames (3)and followed by Reference string each sperated by space(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1)

For example "A.png"

For Belady's Anomaly test use "src.sh" it will give output as "A-2.png"
In that we can clearly see that for string 1 2 3 4 1 2 5 1 2 3 4 5 when we go 3 frames to 4 page faluts increases.


For B part;
To complie B part use "B.sh" file
TO run B part use "./banker"

It will take input from stdio and give output
